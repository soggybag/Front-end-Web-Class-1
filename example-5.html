TITLES OVER BLACK:
1942. WORLD WAR II. THE UNITED STATES BUILDS A MILITARY BASE AT THE EASTERN-MOST POINT OF MONTAUK, NEW YORK.
IT SPANS 278 ACRES. IT IS CALLED CAMP HERO.
1972. THE COLD WAR. AN ALLEGED SERIES OF TOP-SECRET EXPERIMENTS BEGIN TO TAKE PLACE AT CAMP HERO.
DECEMBER, 1980. CAMP HERO IS SHUT DOWN FOR UNDISCLOSED REASONS.
TO THIS DAY, ITS RECORDS REMAIN CLASSIFIED...
EXT. MONTAUK SKY - NIGHT
We FADE UP on the night sky. Dark clouds swallow the stars.
We hear a LOW-END RUMBLE. It sounds almost like thunder, only it is somehow more alive. Like the growl of an unseen beast.
We TILT DOWN to find...
CAMP HERO MILITARY BASE. It is an imposing cement building in a dense forest. A LONG-RANGE SEARCH RADAR DISH rotates atop its roof. Around and around.
Superimpose titles:
CAMP HERO. MONTAUK, NEW YORK.
OCTOBER 5. 1980.
TWO MONTHS BEFORE THE SHUTDOWN.
INT. CAMP HERO - TUNNEL SYSTEM - NIGHT
We move down a long windowless corridor. There is a STEEL DOOR at the end.
We draw closer to this door...
And closer...
And...
WHOOM! THE DOOR SUDDENLY EXPLODES OPEN. THE HINGES SHRIEK.
A SCIENTIST staggers out into the corridor. He is gasping for breath. A Hazmat suit melts off his body. We can see some skin beneath; it is burned, shredded, bloody. His entire left arm is missing.
He collapses to the floor. Twitches. Stills. Dead.
His eyes remain open. Frozen in a look of sheer terror.
We continue past him...
Moving into...
A LABORATORY.
A DOZEN MORE SCIENTISTS lie dead on the ground.
They too, are burned; many also missing limbs. Some, heads.
We survey the lab around them. There are BULKY COMPUTERS, MYSTERIOUS ANALOG EQUIPMENT, and most striking of all:
An ISOLATION TANK, an upright metal cylinder filled with water. A tangle of electrical wires connect this tank to...
A METAL DOOR FRAME. The door leads nowhere; there is just empty white space behind it. The base of the door is on fire.
We watch as this fire begins to spread across the lab. The flames grow hotter...
And hotter...
And...
HISS! FIRE SPRINKLERS kick on.
EXT. SUBURBAN NEIGHBORHOOD - NIGHT
HISS! LAWN SPRINKLERS kick on.
We are now in a 1980s SUBURBAN CUL-DE-SAC. Quiet. Calm.
A row of uniform houses wind up the tree-lined street; station wagons and other family cars fill driveways; TV sets flicker behind drawn curtains; a few dogs bark.
We hear the VOICE OF A YOUNG BOY. Dramatic, intense.
MIKE (O.S.)
Do you hear that? Listen...
We focus on a TWO-STORY HOUSE at the end of the cul-de-sac. The mailbox reads: THE WHEELERS.
MIKE (O.S.) (CONT’D) Something is coming... something
hungry for blood...

INT. WHEELER HOUSE - MIKE’S ROOM - NIGHT
A GROUP OF BOYS, 12 years old, play DUNGEONS AND DRAGONS.
They sit in a circle, their knobby knees buried in carpet. A map is spread out between them, along with an empty pizza box, canned cokes, and the all-important DUNGEONS AND DRAGONS MONSTER MANUAL.
MIKE WHEELER, 12, is the “Dungeon Master.” He is a cute moppy haired kid, classically good looking except for a BIRTHMARK on his left cheek.
MIKE (CONT’D)
A shadow grows on the wall behind
you... swallowing you in darkness... it is almost here...
The other boys lean forward. Riveted. We survey them:
LUCAS CONLEY, 12, playing as a knight. He is very small but his loud mouth more than makes up for it.
DUSTIN HENDERSON, 12, playing as a dwarf. He wears glasses, is overweight, not quite fat, but he’ll get there someday.
WILL BYERS, 12, playing as a wizard. Soft-spoken, gentle.
WILL ...What is it?
DUSTIN The Demogorgon?
WILL
We’re screwed if it’s the
Demogorgon --
LUCAS
It’s not the Demogorgon --
Mike waits for them to settle down. Then:
MIKE
An army of Troglodytes charge into
the chamber!
He slams SIX WINGED MINIATURES onto the map.
MIKE (CONT’D)
Their tails drum the floor. Boom!
Boom! Boom!
DUSTIN Troglodytes?!
3.
LUCAS Toldja!
DUSTIN
Easy.
Mike looks over his shoulder. His eyes grow wide.
MIKE
Wait... do you hear that? Boom!
Boom! BOOM! That sound... it didn’t come from the Troglodytes. No. It came from something behind them...
Mike slams a LARGE TWO-HEADED MONSTER MINIATURE onto the map.
MIKE (CONT’D) THE DEMOGORGON.
The boys stare. Shit. LUCAS
We’re all gonna die.
MIKE Will, your action.
Will swallows. God, he wishes it wasn’t his turn.
WILL
I -- I don’t know --
LUCAS Fireball him --
WILL
I’d have to roll thirteen or
higher --
DUSTIN
Too risky. Cast a protection spell--
LUCAS
Don’t be a pussy! Fireball him!
DUSTIN Protection spell -- !
MIKE
The Demogorgon is tired of your
silly human bickering. It steps toward you. BOOM!
LUCAS FIREBALL HIM Will!
