Front-end web design

Man do I love me some HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, there is so much you can do with this it's incredible!
Not does this stuff work in the browser, these are found in many native tools. You can make web sites
and web based applications, you can also make hybrid and native apps. Everyone is saying "HTML5 is the 
future of web browsing". 

“The problem is there are no simple “right” answers for most Web design questions (at least not for the important ones). 
What works is good, integrated design that fills a need—carefully thought out, well executed, and tested.” 
– Steve Krug

HTML defines the structure. As a markup language HTML is all about adding meaning and context. 
Looking at tags semanticly they explain and define themselves. With this mindset HTML is a 
very intuitive language. 

Where HTML is all about structure and context, CSS is all about presentation. CSS is ridiculously 
powerful in the range of control it provides. Using a few clear decarative lines you can position 
an element with pixel precision, and set it's font style color and other visual features.   

JavaScript brings code to your web pages. Run in the browser JavaScript allows you turn your web pages
into full fledged applications that are accessible to anyone with web browser. 

HTML, CSS, and JavaScript might follow this analogy

- HTML would be the bones
- CSS would be the skin
- JavaScript the muscles

HTML is a simple language built on tags. A tag looks like this: 

<tag>Content</tag>
