Front-end web design

Man do I love me some HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, there is so much you can do with this it's incredible!
Not does this stuff work in the browser, these are found in many native tools. You can make web sites
and web based applications, you can also make hybrid and native apps. 

HTML defines the structure. As a markup language HTML is all about adding meaning and context. 
Looking at tags semanticly they explain and define themselves. With this mindset HTML is a 
very intuitive language. 

Where HTML is all about structure and context, CSS is all about presentation. CSS is ridiculously 
powerful in the range of control it provides. Using a few clear decarative lines you can position 
an element with pixel precision, and set it's font style color and other visual features.   

JavaScript brings code to your web pages. Run in the browser JavaScript allows you turn your web pages
into full fledged applications that are accessible to anyone with web browser. 

HTML, CSS, and JavaScript might follow this analogy

- HTML would be the bones
- CSS would be the skin
- JavaScript the muscles
