### 1 - Intro HTML, CSS, JS

### 2 - Quiz 

[https://b.socrative.com/login/student/](https://b.socrative.com/login/student/) room: L8RR2UUP3

### 3 - Pair lookup quiz questions you missed 

### 4 - HTML Syntax and boilerplate code. 

- Case doesn’t matter, you should always use lowercase and 
- The DOM
  - Children/Child
  - Descendants/Ancestor
  - Parent
- Tags 
  - Opening and closing
  - Some tags don’t close
  - No overlapping tags!
- Boilerplate HTML: [index.html](index.html)
- Attributes, values always quoted

Markup markup: [example 1](example-1.html)

We markup: [example 2](example-2.html)

### 5 - Pair up 

With a partner look at the tag list here:
[http://htmldog.com/references/html/tags/](http://htmldog.com/references/html/tags/)
Markup the [example-4](example-4.html) text using the tags that you think are most appropriate. 

### 6 - Discussion

Discuss tags you found in the list and how you think they could be used. What does HTML markup add to a document?

### 7 - Break 

### 8 - Domains and hosting

Domain name hosting: 

- https://domains.google
- https://www.godaddy.com

Web hosting: 

- https://www.siteground.com/web-hosting.htm
- https://www.bluehost.com

### 9 - Semantic HTML

Tags add context and meaning to content on the page. The golden rule is always choose the tag that describes the 
content best. Understand that sometimes there will be more than one tag, or no tags at all that seem to fit. In these
situations use your best judgement. 

What about tags like: `<sarcasm>`, `<humor>`. When we talk about CSS you will find that CSS provides aural styles. Imagine 
now that the computer can understand and express sarcasm. Whoa, that’s powerful.

More subtly tags like: `<b>` and `<strong>`, `<i>` and `<em>` seem to be doing the same but, from a semantic point of view 
provide a totally different meaning. The `<b>` and `<i>` both describe typographic styles, while `<strong>` and `<em>` 
describe a mode or voice, these tags are about communication, and are always more appropriate. 

The `<img>` also provides some interesting perspective. If an image is part of the content of the page the `<img>` tag is 
appropriate. Any images that might be part of the design of the page should be applied to the page via CSS. 

#### Markup this example

Here is another example, study the tag list and apply as many tags as you can. [Example 4](example-4.html) 

### 10 - Make a web page

We will continue to work on and add features to the pages you create. As of today the page will provide little design, 
you will be adding more as class progresses. Be sure to complete at least one of the following:

- Make a web page for the app you created at Summer Academy
  - Here is an example of an app I created [Example 3](example-3.html)
- Make a web page for yourself. 
  - Imagine making a web site for yourself to host links to your work. 
- Markup Stranger Things [Example 5](example-5.html)
  - Markup this portion of the screenplay for the TV series "Stranger Things". The challenge here is HTML doesn't provide
  tags specifically designed for screenplays. In this case you want to use your judgement and choose tags that make sense.
  You can also use generic tags like div and span assigning class names to add context. For example you can create class
  names like: screen-direction, and audio-cues. 

## Projects and Challenges 
These projects and challenges generate simple marked up content. Do not worry about the appearance we will cover
that in the next class. You must have some web pages to continue with the CSS examples next week. 

You can choose to work on as many or as few of these projects as you like. Be sure to complete the plan for your personal web
site, and one of the HTML markup challenges. 

You do not need a web host or a domain if you don’t plan on posting your work to the web. If you want your work available on
the web to share, you will need a host and a domain name. 

- Make a web page for an app you created
  - Start with a rough sketch of your web page
  - Write the content as text
  - Add markup (ignore styles for now)
- Plan your personal web portfolio
  - Draw some rough sketches that describe the site
  - Write an outline and description of your web site
  - Write some content that will mock up one or more pages of the site
  - Markup your mock up pages
  - Draw a flowchart describing how the content will connect
- Build a website related to your product domain
  - Start with some rough sketches of the site you envision building
  - Write content and collect assets
  - Markup your content
- Challenge: Register a Domain Name
  - Acquire a web host plan
  - Set the domain name server for your web host
  - Upload one or more of your project pages to your web host
- Challenge: Create a design for your web site
  - This could be tough if you are not familiar with any design tools.
