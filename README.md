### 1 - Intro HTML, CSS, JS

### 2 - Quiz 

[https://b.socrative.com/login/student/](https://b.socrative.com/login/student/) room: L8RR2UUP3

### 3 - Pair lookup quiz questions you missed 

### 4 - HTML Syntax and boilerplate code. 

- Case doesn’t matter, you should always use lowercase and 
- Boilerplate HTML: [index.html](index.html)
- Tags 
  - Opening and closing
  - Some tags don’t close
  - No overlapping tags!
- Attributes, values always quoted

I markup markup: [example 1](example-1.html)

We markup: [example 2](example-2.html)

### 5 - Pair up 

With a partner look at the tag list here:
[http://htmldog.com/references/html/tags/](http://htmldog.com/references/html/tags/)
Markup the example text using the tags that you think are most appropriate. 

### 6 - Discussion

Discuss tags you found in the list and how you think they could be used. What does HTML markup add to a document?

### 7 - Break 

### 8 - Domains and hosting

Domain name hosting: 

- https://domains.google
- https://www.godaddy.com

Web hosting: 

- https://www.siteground.com/web-hosting.htm
- https://www.bluehost.com

### 9 - Semantic HTML

Tags add context and meaning to content on the page. The golden rule is always choose the tag that describes the 
element best, while understanding that sometimes there will be more than one, and often it will be a best judgement
situation. 

What about tags like: `<sarcasm>`, `<humor>`. When we talk about CSS you will find that CSS provides aural styles. Imagine 
now that the computer can understand and express sarcasm. Whoa, that’s powerful.

Markup the example using boilerplate and sectional tags. Students follow up by directing the markup of the next document. 

### 10 - Make a web page

We will continue to work on and add features to the pages you create. As of today the page will provide little design, 
you will be adding more as class progresses. Be sure to complete at least one of the following:

- Markup this example
  - Here is another example, study the tag list and apply as many tags as you can. [Example 4](example-4.html)
- Make a web page for the app you created at Summer Academy
  - Here is an example of an app I created [Example 3](example-3.html)
- Make a web page for yourself. 
  - Imagine making a web site for yourself to host links to your work. 
- Markup Stranger Things [Example 5](example-5.html)
  - Markup this portion of the screenplay for the TV series "Stranger Things". The challenge here is HTML doesn't provide
  tags specifically designed for screenplays. In this case you want to use your judgement and choose tags that make sense.
  You can also use generic tags like div and span assigning class names to add context. For example you can create class
  names like: screen-direction, and audio-cues. 

## Projects and Challenges 
These projects and challenges generate simple marked up content, web pages. Do not worry about the appearance we will cover that in the next class. You must have some web pages to continue with the CSS examples next week. 

You can choose to work on as many or as few of these projects as you like. Be sure to complete the plan for your personal web site, and one of the HTML markup challenges. 

You do not need a web host or a domain if you don’t plan on posting your work to the web. If you want your work available on the web to share with the work you will need these. 

- Make a web page for an app you created
  - Start with a rough sketch of your web page
  - Write the content as text
  - Add markup (ignore styles for now)
- Build a website based on your product domain
  - Start with a rough sketch of your page
  - Write content and collect assets
  - Plan your personal web page
  - Write an outline and description of your web site
  - Draw a flowchart describing how the content will connect
  - Draw some rough sketches that describe the site
- Challenge: Register a Domain Name
  - Acquire a web host plan
  - Set the domain name server for your web host
  - Upload one or more of your project pages to your web host
- Challenge: Create a design for your web site
  - This could be tough if you are not familiar with any design tools.
